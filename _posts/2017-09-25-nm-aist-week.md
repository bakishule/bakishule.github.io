During Mandela week at [The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST)](http://www.nm-aist.ac.tz/), I had an opportunity to inspire young girls to pursue science, engineering, technology and innovation. The event aimed at encouraging exploration with technology, promote self-confidence and support aspiration to technical careers. The audience of the event was girls from different secondary schools at Arusha-Tanzania. The event explored various challenges that affect girl students to achieve their dreams and how to overcome those challenges. 

Using a good example of Malala Yousafzai as one of the Noble prize winner who fights for right of girls to education. Girls were excited and encouraged to pursue science, engineering and technology career despite the challenges most girl students face. I was motivated by the feedback of the event and encouraged to participate in more other events that target to inspire young girls. 

We conducted this event together with [Angela Mkindi]()
