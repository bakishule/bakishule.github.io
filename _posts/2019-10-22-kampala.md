In October 2019, I participated in the Academia-Public-Private-Partnership Forum (APPPF) and Exhibitions in Kampala, Uganda.  The APPPF is an annual forum organized by the Inter-University Council for East Africa (IUCEA) in collaboration with the East African Business Council (EABC), East African Development Bank (EADB) and East African Science and Technology Commission (EASTECO). The forum offers a platform for players in the academia, public and private sectors to share information that can enhance complementarity between the sectors for socio-economic transformation of the region. This year, the APPPF also hosted the 1st Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) conference.

The STI conference provides an opportunity for scientists, technologists and innovators from the academia, public and private sectors to share their research information and results for advancement of knowledge, technology and products as well as complementation of activities and potential for outputs to each of the sectors. The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) was among the key players in the APPPF and STI. I had an opportunity to showcased my research findings and presented a poster titled “An Ensemble Predictive Model based Prototype for Student Dropout in Secondary Schools”.
