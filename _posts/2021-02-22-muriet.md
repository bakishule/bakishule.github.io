In January 2021, I visited Muriet Secondary School in Arusha and talk to Form II girls on science and technology and how female scientists can change the world. This sensitization event was purposely conducted to inspire and encourage young girls to pursue science subjects and careers in future.

I was very delighted particularly with the turnout, the energy, the curiosity, the Q&A session, and many more from these beautiful girls. All these reflect their desire for science and technology. I wish them all the best in their studies, and I can’t wait to see them growing up to be doctors, engineers, computer scientists, etc.
