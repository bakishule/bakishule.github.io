In March, 2019, participants of the Deep Learning Indaba 2018 workshop (held in Stellenbosch, South Africa) from the Nelson Mandela African institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) organized a mini IndabaX event with the focus of highlighting fundamentals of Machine learning and Deep Learning research, applications and various potentials. The event also aimed in raising awareness and inspiring more participants from Tanzania to apply for Deep learning Indaba 2019 summer school which will held in Kenyatta university, Nairobi Kenya.

We were privileged to have live presentation from our two guest speakers, Nyalleng Moorosi from Google AI, Accra and Denis Rubanga from Tokyo University of Agriculture, Japan. The topics covered include Machine Learning Overview, Building ML Infrastructure for Social Good, Data Science Africa (DSA) and the link to Deep Learning Indaba (DLI), Overview of Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning Fundamentals and Computer Vision Applications.
