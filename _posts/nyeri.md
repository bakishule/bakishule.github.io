In June 2018, I attended a summer school and workshop which was organised by [Data Science Africa](http://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2018/) with the aim of training participants in Machine Learning and Data Science methods and provide an avenue for researchers to present their work and demonstrate the application of these techniques to problems relevant to African context.

The event was “Training of trainers” under the theme “end-to-end data science”, hosted at Didan Kimath University of Technology in Nyeri, Kenya. The speakers and instructors were from Africa and across the globe.

The summer school was a great success, with informative and interesting programmes. I enjoyed both in class and field works activities. I also had a chance to present my research progress, I was very delighted with the feedbacks and comments given by the audience.
  
The next summer school will be held in Abuja, Nigeria in November, 2018. I encourage others to apply for this wonderful opportunity.
