In October, 2024 I had the amazing opportunity to be part of the Africa Science Leadership Program [ASLP](https://www.aslp.science). This experience was not just about learning, it was about connecting, growing, and celebrating a decade of positive impact in African science leadership!

Meeting brilliant scientists from across Africa was inspiring. We shared ideas, discussed challenges, and explored ways to create real change in our communities. ASLP has been shaping leaders for 10 years, and it was an honor to be part of this milestone celebration.

A special highlight for me was celebrating my birthday during the program! It was such a joy to mark the occasion surrounded by incredible scientists and new friends who made it truly unforgettable.

The program reminded me that leadership in science is not just about research but also about collaboration, mentorship, and making a difference. 

Here's to 10 years of ASLP—and to many more years of growing, learning, and leading together!
