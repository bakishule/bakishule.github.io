In April 2022, we visited our former school Kilakala Secondary and donated 20 computers to help students learn Information and Communication Technology (ICT).

We were also very delighted to hear the girls are doing very well in computer subjects and the school attained the 2nd position last year.

During this visit, I also organize sensitization event with the aim of inspiring young girls to discover their purpose in life, growing up with confidence and pursuing their dreams. The event was a great success, and I am currently organizing the next event, and encourage others to join the movement.
