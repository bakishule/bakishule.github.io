On 11th February 2021, I was privileged to attend the event of celebrating International Day of Women and Girls in Science at Julius Nyerere International Convention Centre in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. The event was organized by Vijana Think Tank, and around 500 girls’ and 100 boys from public schools attended. The guest of honor was the Vice President of United Republic of Tanzania, Hon. Samia Suluhu Hassan.  The event was also attended by other governmental officials including the Minister of Education, Science and Technology (Hon.Professor Joyce Ndalichako) and the Regional Commissioner of Dar es Salaam (Hon. Abubakar Kunenge) as well as prominent women scientists from Tanzania.

As an awardee of L'Oréal-UNESCO for women in Science Young Talents in Sub-Saharan Africa (2020), I had an opportunity to participate in a moderated discussion session on, “Tapping into the potential of women in STEM towards vision 2025 and SDGs 2030.” Afterwards, I was given an opportunity to share my educational journey to the students. My story inspired them and many realized that dreams are valid regardless your gender, background etc as long as you are focused and work hard to attain them.

The following day (12th February 2021), I visited Kisarawe district in Pwani region and was welcomed by the District Commissioner Hon. Jokate Mwegelo. I had an opportunity to introduce BakiShule initiative and the work that we are doing in order to inspire secondary school students particularly girls to pursue science. Hon. Mwegelo was very impressed with our work and she promised the utmost cooperation during our school visit in her district.

My participation in the International Day of Women and Girls in Science enabled me to connect and form networks with officials from public and private sectors, scientists, students etc. As the laurate of the L'Oréal-UNESCO, I also had a chance to talk about how the L'Oréal-UNESCO for Women in Science Programme promotes and recognizes women researchers who are addressing today's global challenges.

I would like to appreciate the L'Oréal-UNESCO foundation and UNESCO NatCom for facilitating my trip and stay in Dar es Salaam.
