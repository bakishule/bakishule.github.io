In December, 2023 I had an opportunity to attend Africa Science Leadership Program (ASLP) which is a new initiative of the University of Pretoria and the Global Young Academy, with the support of the Robert Bosch Stiftung. The program brought together  mid-career African academics in the areas of thought leadership, team management and research development, with the intention of enabling to contribute to the development of a new paradigm for science in African, focused on its contribution to solving the complex issues facing both Africa and the global community.

I was very happy to meet with other Global Young Academy (GYA) members who attended and organized the program.
