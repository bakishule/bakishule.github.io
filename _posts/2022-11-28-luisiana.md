In November 2022, I had an opportunity to attend Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) in New Orleans, Luisiana - USA. The conference brought together researchers and experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) from around the world to present and showcase their work through posters, panel discussion and presentations. I also had a privilege to participate in the Black in AI (BAI) and Women in Machine Learning (WiML) workshops. This time around, I had a wonderful session leading a mentorship and round table discussion at the WiML workshop.
