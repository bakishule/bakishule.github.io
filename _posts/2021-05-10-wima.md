On 24th April 2021, I attended an annual event organized by Women in Management Africa (WIMA). The eventâ€™s main purpose was to celebrate, honor and award outstanding leadership, inspiration, vision and innovation, to individuals (women) and organizations that played a big role in advancing women to the forefront of the economy. The guest of honor for this annual event was the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of NMB Bank Plc, Ms. Ruth Zaipuna; and the special guest was the Minister of Education, Science and Technology, Hon. Prof. Joyce Ndalichako.

I was privileged to be the winner for [WIMA](https://wima.co.tz/wima-awards.php) STEM award. The award was presented to me by Chief Human Resource of NMB Bank Plc, Mr. Emmanuel Akonaay.

I want to take this moment to appreciate the support from everyone who made this possible. Again, receiving this award is a great honor and gives me the strength to keep working hard.
