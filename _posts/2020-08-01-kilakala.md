In August 2020, I attended a sensitization event at Kilakala Secondary School in Morogoro organized by the alumnae with the aim of inspiring young girls to discover their purpose in life, growing up with confidence and pursuing their dreams.

The event was a great success, we managed to support financially some of the students from low income families to cater for their school needs. We are currently planning for the next event, and encourage others to join the movement.
