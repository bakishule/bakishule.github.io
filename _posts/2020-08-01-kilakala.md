In December 2019, I had an opportunity to attend the 33rd annual conference on [Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)](https://nips.cc) in Vancouver, Canada. The conference brought together researchers and experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) from around the world to present and showcase their work through posters, panel discussion and presentations. I also had a privilege to participate in the [Black in AI (BAI)](https://blackinai.github.io) workshop which aims at increasing the presence and participation of black people in the field of AI. This time around, I did an oral presentation on “An Ensemble Predictive Model Based Prototype for Student Drop-out in Secondary Schools”.

I had a fruitful week in Vancouver, not to mention exploring the beautiful places in the city and meeting up with representatives from the  big tech companies i.e. Apple, Google, IBM, Facebook and the list continues. I was happy to see many Tanzanians participating in the conference this year particularly from NM-AIST.

I encourage others especially ladies to keep up the spirit and respond to different calls tirelessly. 

My trip was fully sponsored by [Black in AI (BAI)](https://blackinai.github.io).
