On 08th March 2021, I was among the 5 women that received recognition awards due to their efforts and contributions to the society. The awards were organized by PUMA energy Tanzania and were presented during the International Women’s Day. The awardees were Neema Mduma, Jennifer Bash, Doris Mollel, Selina Letara and Judith Wambura (Lady JayDee).

I want to take this moment to express my sincere gratitude to Puma Energy Tanzania for recognizing me as a woman who impact positive changes to my community particularly in the education sector.
