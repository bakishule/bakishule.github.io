We are very delighted to have received AI4D Post-doctoral researchersâ€™ grant in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in Sub-Saharan Africa. The programme will be very useful particularly in building the capacity for AI research and training at @nmaist_official. Again, we extend our sincere appreciation to the African Center for Technology Studies (ACTS) for awarding us this scholarship.
