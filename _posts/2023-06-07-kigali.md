In June, 2023 I had an opportunity to attend the 2023 Global Young Academy (GYA) Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Kigali, Rwanda. The AGM was held in connection with an International Conference of Young Scientists on the topic “Technological Innovations for Discovering Solutions to the World’s Greatest Current Challenges”. In interactive panels, the Conference addressed new technology and innovation to tackle grand challenges, along with the role of early- to mid-career scientists and scholars in contributing to global, national and regional solutions.

In this gathering, I was privileged to be welcomed as the new member of GYA for the period of five years (2023-2028). Also, I connected with GYA’s members from all disciplines and continents and gained an enriched perspective on the world.
