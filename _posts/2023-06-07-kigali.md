In June, 2023 I had an opportunity to attend the 2023 Global Young Academy (GYA) Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Kigali, Rwanda. The AGM was held in connection with an International Conference of Young Scientists on the topic “Technologocal Innovations for Discovering Solutions to the World’s Greatest Current Challenges”. In interactive panels, the Conference addressed new technology and innovation to tackle grand challenges, along with the role of early- to mid-career scientists and scholars in contributing to global, national and regional solutions.
