January was an inspiring start to the year! I had the privilege of attending the [CIFAR](https://events.cifar.ca/website/80136/home/) Women in Research Leadership Development Symposium in Kigali, Rwanda. A big thank you to the Mastercard Foundation for bringing us together and creating a space for learning, sharing and empowerment.

At the symposium, I met incredible women leaders from different research fields. It was inspiring to hear their experiences and learn from their journeys. I also appreciated how the symposium invited a few men as ambassadors, encouraging them to be part of the conversation about the challenges women face in leadership.

One key message stood out: empowering women does not mean destroying men, it means giving equal opportunities to all. Too often, women are not given the same chances as men, and this needs to change.

Another powerful takeaway was the 3Vs:
ðŸ”¹ Be Visible â€“ Speak up, show up and make your presence known
ðŸ”¹ Be Viable â€“ Keep growing, learning and staying relevant
ðŸ”¹ Be Valuable â€“ Contribute meaningfully and make an impact in your field.

This event reminded me of the power of inclusion, mentorship and leadership. I left Kigali feeling motivated and hopeful for a future where more women lead in research and beyond!
