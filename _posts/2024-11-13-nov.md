November 2024 was truly an unforgettable month! I had the honor of receiving multiple invitations to incredible events, each offering unique insights and opportunities to connect with inspiring people.

I started with an invitation to the U.S. Embassy, where I had an insightful discussion with their Economic Team about the digital economy and the future of ICT. It was a great exchange of ideas on where technology is headed and how innovation can drive progress.

Later, I joined Air France-KLM for a special tree-planting event with the Kilimanjaro Project, celebrating Air France’s first flight from Paris to Kilimanjaro. It was a beautiful moment, combining sustainability with aviation history.

Another highlight was being invited to a dinner party hosted by H.E. Nicole Providoli, Switzerland’s Ambassador-Designate to Tanzania. It was a wonderful evening of networking and cultural exchange.

November was a reminder of how powerful connections can be when people come together with shared passions for technology, sustainability, and diplomacy. Looking forward to more exciting moments ahead!
