On October 4 to 6 2017, I had an opportunity to attend  [Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC-2017)](https://ghc.anitab.org/calendar/2017-grace-hopper-celebration-women-computing/) conference for women in computing which was held at Orlando, Florida USA. The Grace Hopper Celebration is the world's largest gathering of women technologists. It is produced by [AnitaB.org](https://anitab.org/) and presented in partnership with ACM. The conference aim to connect, inspire, and guide women in computing, and organizations that view technology innovation as a strategic imperative. I was impressed by keynote speakers Melinda Gates, Dr. Fei-Fei Li and Dr. Sue Black OBE. These speakers helped me to see in a different way the role and value of women in transforming a society. The speech by Dr Fei-Fei Li stimulated my ambition to invest more in Artificial Intelligence (A.I). According to Fei, *"A.I will change the world who will change A.I"*. I therefore encourage girls to invest in this amazing technology.

We had an opportunity to meet big technology companies like Google, HP, Amazon, Twitter, Snapchat, Microsoft, Facebook just to mention a few. At [AnitaB.org](https://anitab.org/) booth I framed the following **I am** statement; *I am a data-scientist who is ready to support girls education*. This is my mission and I am striving to promote the use of data to support education especially in developing countries.

My trip was fully sponsored by HP company and I had a chance to attend their welcoming event at Sea world, Orland. GHC-2017 was an amazing experience that helped me gain additional skills, knowledge and exposure. I encourages all other women in the field to pursue the scholarship that will be open in February 2018. If you want more information, don't hesitate  to reach out [AnitaB.org](https://anitab.org/).
