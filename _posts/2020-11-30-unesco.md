The L’Oréal-UNESCO for Women in Science Sub-Saharan Africa regional program aims to promote and encourage the participation of young African women in science. This program identifies and rewards young talented researchers in life and environmental sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, computer and information sciences, engineering sciences and technological sciences

In November 2020, I was privileged to be among the 20 laurates for Young Talents in Sub-Saharan Africa awarded by the L’Oréal-UNESCO. This award is a recognition for my PhD work for developing a Machine Learning web-based application called “BakiShule” to allow education stakeholders to easily predict and identify students who are at risk of dropping out of school for early intervention. The selection was based on the quality of the application, scientific excellence in research and ability to communicate and promote science to young people.

The 20 Young Talents were chosen among the 330 applications by the jury of eminent scientists led by Prof. Nelson Torto, Executive Director of African Academy of Sciences (AAS). To support the Young Talents from Sub-Saharan Africa, the Foundation L’Oréal-UNESCO will deliver them grants to help them continue with their scientific work, with allocations of €10,000 for doctoral students and €15,000 for post-doctoral students.
