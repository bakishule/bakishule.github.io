In July 2019, I attended the second annual ACM SIGCAS [Conference on Computing and Sustainable Societies (COMPASS 2019)](https://acmcompass.org) in Accra, Ghana. The conference brought together researchers with broad expertise in artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, networking, systems, speech and language processing, computer security, data mining, and computer vision. The focus was to apply this knowledge to solve the diverse problems in sustainable development, spanning health, accessibility, education, agriculture, financial services, job creation and governance.

The conference was very well organised. I had a chance to present findings from the work titled, “Towards Mobile Application for Poultry Information Management” by Dina Machuve (The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology) and Ezinne Nwankwo (Duke University).

The next conference will be conducted in Ecuador. I encourage others to apply and not missing this great opportunity.
