On 25th April 2024, I had a chance to give a talk before Hon. Maryprisca Mahundi, beautiful girls from kindergarten all the way to university, and other distinguished guests at the International Day of Girls in ICT. Huge thanks to TCRA for inviting me to such an incredible event. Together, weâ€™re breaking barriers and shaping the future of technology! ðŸ’»ðŸš€ #GirlsInICT #Leadership #BakiShuleðŸ“š
