What an exciting way to close the year! Yesterday, I was thrilled to witness the official launch of Tanzania Development Vision 2050 (TDV 2050). This ambitious plan outlines a bright future for our country, with digital transformation as one of the key drivers. The next 25 years promise innovation, growth, and progress for Tanzania!

With the launch, the validation process has now begun. People from different backgrounds are sharing their ideas and contributing to shape the Tanzania they want by 2050. It is inspiring to see so many voices coming together to build a better tomorrow!

As a member of the technical team for drafting TDV 2050, I had the incredible opportunity to work with experts from various fields, all under the leadership of Hon. Ambassador Dr. Asha-Rose Migiro. She is not only my role model but also an inspirational leader to many.

I am deeply grateful to Hon. Prof. Kitila Mkumbo, Minister of State, President’s Office Planning and Investment, for appointing me to this role. His trust gave me the chance to learn, contribute, and be part of shaping the future of my country.
