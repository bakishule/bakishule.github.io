In April 2016 during my Mastersâ€™ degree, my team represented the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) in the 14th annual Business Plan competition in Washington State University, Pullman (USA). The competition attracted different teams with brilliant and innovative ideas from different universities in USA and our team from NM-AIST, Arusha, Tanzania.

It was my first time in USA, the trip was fun and enjoyable particularly the Dubai layover. I was very excited to learn and experience the new culture. Apart from the competition, I was able to explore and enjoy the natural environment of the Pullman city.
