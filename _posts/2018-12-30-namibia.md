In May, 2017 I attended an [IST Africa conference](http://www.ist-africa.org/Conference2017/default.asp) which was conducted in Windhoek, Namibia. I had an opportunity to present my research paper with the title  [“Enhancing Management of Nutrition Information using Mobile Application: Prenatal and Postnatal requirements”](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8102282).

The conference was well organised, I enjoyed presenting my research work. The audience responded with positive feedbacks and useful inputs. I encourage others to attend conferences and share their works.
