In December 2018, I attended Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, Women in Machine Learning (WiML) and Black in Artificial Intelligence (BAI) workshops in Montreal, Canada. The events brought together different experts from across the globe in the field of machine learning, computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The workshops featured different talks, demonstrations, symposia, oral and poster presentations where I had a chance to present my research and receive very useful feedbacks and comments from the audience.
