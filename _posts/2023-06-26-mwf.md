From June to August, 2023 I had an opportunity to attend Mandela Washington Fellowship in University of Georgia, United States of America (USA). The Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders is the flagship program of the U.S. Government’s Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI). The fellowship brought together outstanding young leaders from different part of Sub-Saharan Africa. I was very grateful to learn from other leaders and exchange my leadership skills with others, participated in academic program, community activities and family visit.

In the last week of the fellowship, all fellows were gathered in Washington DC to participate in the summit. I was privileged to have received a special invitation to attend a policy panel with the Senior U.S. Government Leadership at the White House in Washington DC and discuss on challenges facing African countries including adoption of emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, automation etc and how U.S. can support and help speeding up this transition.

I encourage others to apply for this prestigious fellowship: https://www.mandelawashingtonfellowship.org
