In December 2022, I was grateful to be announced among the winners of the 2022 Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD) Early Career Fellowship.

This prestigious award comes with a financial support of USD 50,000 to help facilitate my research activities on the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in early detection of crop diseases in Tanzania.

I will also receive professional support to help establish good environment at the NM-AIST where I can maintain an international standard of research and attract scholars from all over the world to collaborate.
