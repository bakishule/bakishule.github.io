In May 2022, I had an opportunity to attend UNESCO World Higher Education Conference in Barcelona, Spain. In this conference, I was privileged to give a HED Talk and join an insightful panel discussion with the experts and like minded leaders on the issues of equity, inclusion and pluralism in higher education.
