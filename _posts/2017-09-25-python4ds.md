As part of [pythontz](https://pythontz.github.io/) event, I had an opportunity to present a talk on practical approach that aimed at giving an accessible introduction to how to use machine learning techniques using [scikit-learn]():a package that provides efficient versions of a large number of common algorithms.[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a Python open source library designed to tackle Machine Learning problems from beginning to end.

The talk covered the following aspects:

1. [Introduction to scikit-learn](https://github.com/neylicious/python4MachineLearning-NMAIST/blob/master/notebook/Part%201-Introduction%20to%20sklearn.ipynb)
2. [Data-preprocessing](https://github.com/neylicious/python4MachineLearning-NMAIST/blob/master/notebook/Part%202-Practical%20Machine%20Learning%20with%20Sklearn.ipynb)
3. [Feature engineering](https://github.com/neylicious/python4MachineLearning-NMAIST/blob/master/notebook/Part%203-Feature%20Selection%20and%20Model%20Selection.ipynb)
4. [Model tuning and evaluation](https://github.com/neylicious/python4MachineLearning-NMAIST/blob/master/notebook/Part%204-Modeltuning%20and%20Evaluation.ipynb)

The resources for this talk can be accessed [here](https://github.com/neylicious/python4MachineLearning-NMAIST) .We presented this talk together with [Anthony Faustine](https://sambaiga.github.io/)
