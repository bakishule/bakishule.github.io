On December 2017, I had an opportunity to attend three workshops, which were held at Long Beach, California (USA). 
The first workshop was [Women in Machine Learning] (http://wimlworkshop.org/2017/). In this workshop, I was able to present our 
poster titled “Reducing Students Dropout Rates: A Machine Learning Approach”. 
The second workshop was [Neural Information Processing Systems] (https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017). 
In this workshop, I learnt a lot of useful topics from various presenters in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The last workshop was [Black in AI] (https://blackinai.github.io). This workshop aimed on providing rooms for sharing ideas and discussions in order to increase the presence of Black people in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

In that productive week, we had an opportunity to connect and network with big companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook and so many others. Furthermore, I was extremely excited to present our research idea to the gurus such as Prof. Neil Lawrence who is professor of machine learning at the university of Sheffield and Prof. Hanna Wallach who is the expert of Machine Learning, computational social science.

My trip was full sponsored by WiML and Black in AI. I encourage others to keep connected and establish the tendency of applying various opportunities in order to expose themselves in this emerging field.
