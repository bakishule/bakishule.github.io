In December 2017, I had an opportunity to attend three workshops, which were held in Long Beach, California (USA). 
The first workshop was [Women in Machine Learning](http://wimlworkshop.org/2017/). I presented my
poster titled “Reducing Students Dropout Rates: A Machine Learning Approach”.

The second workshop was [Neural Information Processing Systems](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017), where I learnt a lot from diverse of presenters in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

The last workshop was [Black in AI](https://blackinai.github.io) which aimed to provide rooms for sharing ideas and discussions in order to increase the presence of Black people in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

In that productive week, we had an opportunity to connect with big companies just to mention a few; Apple, Google and Facebook. Furthermore, I was extremely excited to present my research idea to the gurus in the field of Machine Learning such as Prof. Neil Lawrence and Prof. Hanna Wallach.

My trip was fully sponsored by [Women in Machine Learning](http://wimlworkshop.org/2017/) and [Black in AI](https://blackinai.github.io). I encourage others particularly ladies to keep up the spirit and respond to different calls and expose themselves in this emerging field.
