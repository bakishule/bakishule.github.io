In June 2019, I was able to attend summer school and workshop which was organised by [Data Science Africa](http://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2018/) with the aim of training participants on Machine Learning and Data Science methods and provide an avenue for researchers to present their work and demonstrate the application of these techniques in solving problems in the African context. The event was held at Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia.

The summer school targeted graduate students, researchers and professionals working with huge amounts of data or unique datasets. The workshop on the other hand, organized a round paper presentations and interactive panel discussions. The speakers and instructors were from Africa and across the globe. Summer school programmes were intense and useful. I was able to facilitate Python, Pandas and Jupyter tutorials during summer school and present my ongoing PhD research during the workshop.

The next event will be conducted in Accra, Ghana on October, 2019. I encourage others to apply for this great opportunity.
