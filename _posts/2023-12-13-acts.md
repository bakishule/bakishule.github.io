On 10-14 December, 2023 I had an opportunity to attend the AI4D Africa scientific conference organized by the universities of Addis Ababa and Bahir Dar in partnership with the African Centre for Technology Studies (ACTS).

The conference aimed to facilitate the exchange of ideas and expertise among scholars, researchers and students to enhance the understanding of cutting-edge research in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). I was very happy to attend the conference with students I supervise under the AI4D Africa scholarship project.
