The conference aimed to facilitate the exchange of ideas and expertise among scholars, researchers and students to enhance the understanding of cutting-edge research in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). I was very happy to attend the conference with students I supervise under the AI4D Africa scholarship project.
