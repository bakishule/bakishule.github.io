In November 2023, I was honored to be announced among the two winners of the Agricultural Research Grants from the Grow Further organization. The call was highly competitive, attracting more than 700 applications from researchers around the world, and only two proposals were selected for funding based on their potential to make a significant impact in smallholder agriculture.

My team will receive a financial support of USD 63,000 to help develop a mobile app that farmers will use to promptly diagnose crop diseases and manage them before causing significant economic losses. 

"We are very impressed with the quality of the applications we have received," said Peter Kelly (CEO of Grow Further). "The two winning projects (Ghana and Tanzania) have the potential to transform smallholder agriculture, improve nutrition, and help beat back food insecurity".
