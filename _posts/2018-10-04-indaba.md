In September, 2018 I was privileged to attend a [Deep learning Indaba summer school](http://www.deeplearningindaba.com) which was held in Stellenbosch University, South Africa. The summer school aimed at strengthening African Machine Learning and topics covered includes  introduction to machine learning, feed-forward networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and reinforcement learning.

During this busy week, I had a chance to present my research progress and I was happy with the inputs and feedback. I enjoyed all the sessions in this summer school, particularly the evening session of Women in Machine Learning which was organised by Microsoft. The stories shared by successful women in the field of Machine Learning were very inspirational and encouraging.

As part of knowledge dissemination, we are planning to organize the IndabaX_Tanzania, to create a room for knowledge sharing with other people who didnâ€™t get a chance to attend the summer school. More details about this arrangement will be announced through [Pythontz official page](https://pythontz.github.io).

I would like to thank [Google](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/google-travel-and-conference-grants/#!?detail-content-tabby_activeEl=detail-europe-content ) for sponsoring my participation to this productive event.
