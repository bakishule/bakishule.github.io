On 24th March 2022, I was delighted to welcome new members of AI community at NM-AIST. We had interactive discussions on various AI initiatives and opportunities i.e. Data Science Africa (DSA), Deep Learning Indaba (DLI), Black in AI (BAI), Women in Machine Learning (WiML) etc. Iâ€™ve also encouraged them to apply for DLI in Tunisia and Junior researchers award
