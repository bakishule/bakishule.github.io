In June, 2024 I attended the Eastern Africa Sub-Regional Forum on Artificial Intelligence organized by UNESCO

In this Forum, I participated in the AI Leadership panel discussion moderated by Mr. Alexandros K. Makarigakis (Director of UESCO East Africa). It was truly eye-opening! Iâ€™m excited to put the ideas and lessons I learned into action and shape the future of AI in my community. #AI #ArtificialIntelligence #Leadership #UNESCO
