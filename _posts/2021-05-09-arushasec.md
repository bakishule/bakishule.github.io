In April 2021, I had a privilege to visit Arusha Secondary School in Arusha and talk to form II girls. The event was purposely conducted to spark STEM interest in girls and the importance of science and technology in today’s decade.

The session was very interactive, particularly the Q&A i.e. I was asked a lot of questions and these young beautiful girls were curious to know what are the tricks to master science subjects, opportunities, challenges and obstacles etc. All these shows their love and desire for science and technology. I wish them all the best in their studies, and I can’t wait to see them growing up to become scientists.
