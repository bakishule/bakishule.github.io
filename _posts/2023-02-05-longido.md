In January 2023, I had a privilege to visit Longido, Engarenaibor and Namanga Secondary Schools in Longido district and talk to students. The event was purposely conducted to spark STEM interest in girls and the importance of science and technology in todayâ€™s decade.

The sessions were very interactive and I was accompaned by NM-AIST students of STEMi Africa. All visited schools were supported with the seed fundings for the establishment of the science clubs.
