 In August, 2023 I had an opportunity to attend STI Capacity Building Programme on Female Researchers and Entrepreneurs to Promote the Bio-Circular Green Economic (BCG) Model in Bangkok, Thailand. The programme was organized by the United Nations with the aim of building capacity of female researchers and entrepreneurs across the world. In this interactive capacity building programme to promote green economy, I learnt different measures to keep the planet safe for the healthy future.

I was very happy to meet with other female researchers and entrepreneurs from different part of the world. Also, it was my privilege to meet with other Global Young Academy (GYA) members who attended and organized the programme.
