On 06th December 2019, I attended ASW celebrations which was hosted at NM-AIST in Arusha. The event was organized by Next Einstein Forum (NEF) for the third time in Tanzania. The main focus was to encourage people of different age groups to get involved and ignite their passion for science and technology across the continent. This time the ASW engaged STEM stakeholders and students from primary, secondary and university in different exciting activities which includes: (i) Panel discussion - The state of STEM careers in Africa; what has been the contribution of women (ii) Launching of STEMi Mentorship and Coaching Platform for Africa (STEMi-Africa) (iii) Awarding Tanzanian Women in Science and (iv) Exhibition from various STEM stakeholders.

I was very happy to receive a certificate of “Recognizing Women in Science” for my work as a career woman in STEM.
