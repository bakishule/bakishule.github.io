Neema Mduma is a Tanzanian academic and computer engineering professional, she is currently a PhD candidate in the school of Computational and Communication Science and Engineering at [the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology](http://www.nm-aist.ac.tz/). Her focus is on supporting education and presently she is conducting a study on developing a data-driven approach for predicting student dropout in secondary schools. 
Neema enjoys conducting community services as well as sharing her experiences and knowledge among youth to strive towards making a difference in their lives. This triggered her passion to offer inspiration and career coaching to youth in her community. She has thus been among the advisors of a peer educators group that voluntarily provides education to the youth and other people around the community, at no cost to the beneficiaries.
